External Requirements:
• Installation of Python 3.6 and it's extension, pygame. This will also install Python's text editor, IDLE
• Space Pirate v3.5.py and it's corresponding data file needs to be extracted in the same directory

Setup and Installation:
1. Open IDLE
2. Within IDLE, go to File > Open and browse for Space Pirate v3.5.py to open it. This should open a text editor which displays the source code
3. Within the text editor, go to Run > Run Module to play the game

Rules:
• There are three types of attacks that correspond to different colors: Red, Green, and Yellow
• There are three different types of enemies that correspond to those colors as well
• The weakness of every enemy is the determined by the color of the enemy. For example, a red-colored enemy is weak against red-type attacks from the player
• Exploiting your enemies’ weaknesses will defeat them and is the key to victory
• Every ship can only take one hit and that includes yours. Stay sharp and avoid your enemies’ maneuvers and their projectiles!
• After 2 minutes, you would have survived the battle and you be declared the winner

Features: In this game, the only way you can defeat your enemies is by knowing their weakness. However, the player can be killed by any of their attacks, 
so make sure to be careful and avoid them

Known Bugs/Issues: 
• Spawned enemies may stay stuck on the right side of the screen. The development team will address this issue in the next iteration
• Whenever a player projectile will collide with two enemies that happen to be occupying the same area, both enemies will die with the one player projectile
